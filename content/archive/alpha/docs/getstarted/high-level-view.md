Oakestra lets you deploy your workload on devices of any size, from a small RasperryPi to a cloud instance far away on GCP or AWS. The tree structure enables you to create multiple clusters of resources.

* The **Root Orchestrator** manages different clusters of resources. The root only sees aggregated cluster resources.
* The **Cluster Orchestrator** manages your worker nodes. This component collects real-time resources and schedules your workloads to the perfect matching device.
* A **Worker** is where your workloads are executed. E.g., your containers. 

>> ince the stable Accordion release, Oakestra supports both containers and unikernel virtualization targets.
